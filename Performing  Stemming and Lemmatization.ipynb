    "### Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of reducing inflected/derived words to their word stem, base or root form. The stem need not be identical to original word. There are many ways to perform stemming such as lookup table, suffix-stripping algorithms etc. These mainly rely on chopping-off ‘s’, ‘es’, ‘ed’, ‘ing’, ‘ly’ etc from the end of the words and sometimes the conversion is not desirable. But nonetheless, stemming helps us in standardizing tex"
